CA2RC-SAT hopes to be Carleton University's first satellite launched into orbit. This project began in September, 2023 as a part of the Carleton Aerospace Astrophysics Radio Club (CA2RC). Our goal is to allow students to gain valuable experience regarding satellite design and manufacturing, allowing them to transition in to Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP). I hold a leadership role within this project both as the vice-president of the club and also the mechanical team lead for the satellite. Some of my roles and accomplishments within the project include:

- Completed a mock first Preliminary Design Review (PDR) regarding the structural and thermal design of the cube satellite.
- Performed preliminary thermal analysis of 3U CA2RC-SAT components using Systems Toolkit (STK) and designed thermoregulation architecture to ensure optimal operating temperature for all parts.
- Drafted the first CAD model of CA2RC-SAT using Onshape, integrating all subsystems together.
- Performed preliminary structural analysis of CubeSat structures for random /sinusoidal vibration, and acceleration loads in Ansys, ensuring the structure met the requirements of launch providers.
- Leading project management for creating a funding proposal for CSA’s CUBICS program in summer 2025, hoping to secure $350,000 for the project.

CA2RC has also been involved in high-altitude balloon (HAB) experiments, a key initiative of the club. Last year, during the total eclipse in April, we successfully launched a high-altitude balloon to measure atmospheric changes, specifically NO2 levels. As a leader within this project, I played an integral role in both the planning and execution phases. Some of my roles and accomplishments for this mission include:

- Coordinated the launch event on the day of the total eclipse, ensuring the experiment's timing aligned with peak conditions for atmospheric measurement.
- Led the design and structural assembly of the payload housing, ensuring durability and safety during the balloon’s ascent to the stratosphere.
- Managed part procurement, including sourcing high-altitude balloon components, sensors, and tracking systems, all within budget constraints.
- Developed the framework for mounting and securing all payload components, allowing for easy retrieval post-flight without damage to critical sensors.

As an undergraduate assistant at Carleton University's Spacecraft Manufacturing lab led by Bruce Burlton, I am helping out capstone students with CuSAT, the university's satellite design project. CuSAT is a 3U cube satellite tasked with identifying wildfire locations using its thermal camera:

- Designed parts in Onshape for 3D printing and machining regarding a prototype of a ground station that communicates with satellites in low earth and geostationary orbits.
- Prototyping cube satellite sun sensors in house using photo diodes and light intensity algorithms to meet mission pointing requirements.
- Assisting fourth year capstone students with part design and assembly as a member of the satellite design project led by Bruce Burton at the Carleton University Spacecraft Manufacturing Lab.

As a part of my internship at Space Copy, I led the development of a specialized robotic arm gripper designed for adaptability and robustness in Lunar environments.. The end-effector was intended to handle parts produced by a Lunar 3D printer, ensuring reliable operation even in harsh conditions such as the presence of lunar dust. My primary focus was on designing a versatile and efficient underactuated gripper that could handle parts of varying sizes and shapes. This required a balance between mechanical simplicity, strength, and reliability in an environment where regular maintenance is not feasible. The project also included testing the gripper for its durability and performance. My key contributions and achievements include:

- Created a custom CAD model using Onshape, integrating tendon-driven mechanisms that allowed for greater flexibility in grasping objects. The design considered minimal actuation points to reduce complexity and damage by Lunar dust, while maximizing adaptability to various 3D-printed geometries.
- Designed the gripper for 3D printing and ease of manufacturability, which ensured lightweight components without compromising strength. This was crucial for space applications where mass and material usage are heavily constrained.
- Conducted a complete cycle from 3D printing to assembly, followed by iterative testing to refine the gripper’s performance. The tests focused on the gripper's ability to handle irregularly shaped objects, ensuring reliability and adaptability under real world conditions.
- Ensured long-term functionality and low maintenance requirements were present within the design, which critical when considering the robotic arms placement within the printing chamber.

For the 2024 Red Bull Soapbox Race in Edmonton, I led the design and construction of a giant functioning calculator-themed soapbox. The project aimed to not only be visually striking but also feature interactive elements like working buttons and screens, adding to the novelty and creativity of the build. The project required a combination of engineering, fabrication, and financial management to bring it to life, while adhering to the race guidelines. Our team “Algebros” placed top 5 out of 60 teams in categories of design, construction, and speed. My key contributions and responsibilities:

- Developed the entire soapbox CAD design in Onshape, ensuring the calculator theme was fully integrated into the soapbox's structure. I balanced form and function, ensuring that the giant calculator design was both operational and aerodynamically sound for the race.
- Constructed the project through cutting, welding, and assembling the soapbox, ensuring structural integrity while incorporating all interactive elements like functioning buttons and a display. This hands-on involvement ensured that the soapbox maintained both its aesthetic appeal and mechanical performance.
- Managed a team of 6, coordinating efforts to ensure timely completion. I also handled the day-to-day logistics of the project, such as organizing work schedules and ensuring that tasks were distributed evenly across the team.
- Oversaw all aspects of budgeting and procurement, sourcing materials, electronic components, and structural parts while maintaining cost-efficiency. This involved negotiating prices, staying within budget, and ensuring all parts were delivered on time.    `,

As a part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge in Ottawa, members from CA2RC came together to compete in the global hackathon. Over 48 hours, we developed Landsat Lab, a web app aimed to make Landsat Data more accessible  to citizen scientists and other users. My roles and accomplishments in this project include:

- Provided in-depth knowledge of satellite data and remote sensing theory to inform the design and assembly of the Landsat Lab platform, ensuring accurate data interpretation.
- Led the integration of Landsat 8 and 9 data streams, configuring APIs to retrieve and display real-time surface reflectance data for users.
- Designed the framework for pixel-level data analysis and visualization, allowing users to efficiently interpret satellite data and compare it with ground measurements.
- Contributed to the design of the satellite overpass notification system, applying knowledge of satellite dynamics to provide precise alerts for users.
- Assisted in testing and validating the platform’s capabilities, ensuring it could handle large datasets and deliver accurate, responsive results across various devices and browsers.`,
